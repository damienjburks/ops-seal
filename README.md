## 🚀 Overview

**OpsSeal** is a personal prototype application built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that allows for quick testing and experimentation with various infrastructure tools like:

- 🧠 **Redis Open Source** – for fast in-memory caching
- 🔐 **HashiCorp Vault** – for secure secrets management
- 🧰 Future tools (TBD) – expand and integrate as needed

It’s meant to be a flexible, sandbox-style app for developing, testing, and playing with service integrations in a secure and structured way.
